## Overview

**Venno** is a way for friends to keep a ledger of financial transactions between each other without needing to immediately pay and receive money every time. Think of it like opening a tab with your buddy. They got dinner last weekend, you bought drinks at the game, and you'll owe them for the wedding on Saturday. Whatever, they know you're good for it.

<br>

## MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

The **Project Title** MVP will allow users to create and access an account, start ledgers with other users, submit transactions, and settle their ledgers. No money at this point, just an honor system.

<br>

### Goals

- User signup/signin
- Backend supporting users, accounts, ledgers, and transactions
- Users can find other users
- Users can approve charges from other users
- Users can see outstanding transactions for each ledger

<br>
